kruskal : It wouldn't work because the cycles can't be correctly identified in directed graphs. I tried checking cycles with C++ but it didn't work in every case.
prim : It won't work because in a directed graph the algo can't traceback to find the smallest edge from the visited nodes. prim is a node based approach and it can't traceback in directed gragh.I've submitted the noraml prims code for undirected positive weighted graphs. 
dijkstra : It won't work for the negative edges because in the greedy approach the immediate next adges are only considered and the penalty in next edge wouldn't be considered.I didn't have time to code dijkstra.
